    On Tuesday March 15, 2011, all 1,200 global Partners of McKinsey & Co. gathered
    at the Gaylord National Hotel & Convention Center near Washington, DC for their
    annual Partners'' conference. The atmosphere was tense as Partners, in addition
    to their normal agenda, discussed the Galleon Group insider-trading trial and
    the recent allegations against the Firm''s former Managing Director, Rajat Gupta.
    Three months earlier Senior Partner, Anil Kumar, pled guilty to providing confidential
    information about McKinsey clients he served to Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam.
    The McKinsey Partners were shocked and dismayed by the actions of Kumar, as well
    as the recent allegations against Gupta and were closely monitoring the situation.
    Could a former Managing Director of their Firm have conspired to enable insider
    trading? And if so,what did that mean for the future of the Firm?

    In December 1997 United Rentals (URI) went public on the NYSE. Ten years later,
    during the peak of the economic meltdown, the company''s performance was in decline.
    United Rentals had experienced its share of problems in the prior years and was
    still struggling to emerge from this turmoil.


    In the spring of 2008, the recession had decimated the company''s core business,
    construction equipment rental. The economic downturn resulted in a significant
    decrease in North American construction and industrial activities and had adversely
    affected the company''s revenues and operating result. The stock of the company
    quickly fell from the mid-$30 range in late 2007 to $3 in March 2009. In addition,'
  - ' two of the company''s former chief financial officers had been charged with
    securities fraud and otherviolations, by both the U.S. Attorney''s office and
    the SEC. The Board was faced with the resignation of the founder and chairman,
    management succession issues, the failed merger with Cerberus, and the lawsuit
    in Delaware. The Board was responsible for overseeing the change in a number of
    senior management and board positions which became increasingly difficult due
    to the turmoil and poor performance of the company. Recruiting and retaining talent
    in senior management and the board was central to the success of the company,
    which relied on their people for strong performance. In addition the company''s
    total indebtedness was approximately $3.3 billion, including $146 million of subordinated
    convertible debenture. The company''s substantial indebtedness had the potential
    to have adverse consequences in a number of ways, including: increase theirother
    meetings she had chaired. Stockholders were about to vote on a transaction that
    was perhaps the ultimate fulfillment of the founders'' original vision. She was
    reminded of the company''s founding just 15 years earlier and its meteoric growth.
    With a considerable sense of achievement and satisfaction, she reflected on her
    tenure as board chair commencing five years ago. Elected to the board in 2006
    and then unanimously selected by her peers as Chairman in June 2008, Britell led
    the board through the aftermath of a tumultuous period that included senior management
    and board changes, a SEC investigation, financial restatements, the jilting of
    the company by Cerberus Capital Management in a transaction to acquire URI, and
    the deepest recession to hit the global economy since the Great Depression.At
    the meeting, stockholders would be asked to consider approval of a merger agreement
    between URI, the largest equipment rental company in the world, with RSC, the
    second largest equipment rental company in the world and URI''s largest competitor.
    The meeting would mark the triumph of a new governance model and company strategy
    whose development and implementation Britell and CEO Michael Kneeland had led.
    As Britell reflected on the hard won gains, she also looked forward to the challenges
    and opportunities that lay ahead as the company managed the integration of RSC''s
    operations with URI and the integration of three new board members from the acquired
    company. She also reflected on how governance and strategy could continue to evolve
    as the company planned for the next five years.


    learningyour health, hence the term passive tolerance.


    This is the finding of seven studies carried out over 10 years in the United States,
    Europe and South Africa, led by a team of social psychologists at the University
    of Oxford and published in the journal of the United States National Academy of
    Sciences. They were careful to rule out the most obvious explanation for their
    finding, social psychologists Miles Hewstone and Katharina Schmid explain – namely,
    that the higher levels of tolerance in more diverse neighbourhoods are a result
    of more tolerant people choosing to live there. Two of the studies were conducted
    over several years and tracked the same individuals, showing how attitudes changed.
    Even prejudiced people showed a greater degree of tolerance over time if they
    lived inpeople in a modern welfare state". The left faces a nasty conund'
  - 'rum as two of its most sacred shibboleths come into conflict: ethnic diversity
    and the solidarity necessary for a strong welfare state.


    This new research throws these conclusions into question. Putnam''s work may,
    after all, have been misleading. In fact, rather than hunkering down, living in
    a mixed neighbourhood helps you open up. In some ways this vindicates many people''s
    anecdotal experience of their own enjoyment of diversity in their neighbourhoods,
    and the sense that the most pronounced fear and prejudice is found in exclusively
    white areas.


    The research also vindicates the case for local initiatives to foster social exchange
    and build community relationships. From carnivals to coffee mornings, jumble sales
    to fun days in the park – allthese are opportunities to generate passive tolerance.
    Sadly, however, many of these initiatives have fallen victim to local authority
    funding cuts. The impact of austerity has been compounded by a loss of confidence
    – in which Putnam''s research played its part – about fostering strong diverse
    communities. Multiculturalism has fallen from favour, misunderstood and maligned
    as the set of ideas that guided community relations for a generation.


    No one was more acutely aware of this danger than Putnam himself when he talked
    to me on the publication of his research in 2007, the timing made the danger all
    the more acute in the aftermath of 7/7 bombings. Since then the theme of integration
    has come to dominate – with its coercive and conformist overtones. The result
    has been ahad to fight Ahenobarbus like 4 times because he kept letting him

    go.


    With that, Caesar turned into an absolute master by making reasonable

    calculated risks and surviving them. By the point he was clearing the last of

    the Pompeans in Africa at the end of the Civil War, he didn''t even leave his

    tent to give commands -- so confident and expertised in warfare that he didn''t

    even have to see the field of battle.


    This is a bit of a ramble. I really admire Julius Caesar and think there''s so

    much to learn by studying his life and habits.

    "By the point he was clearing the last of the Pompeans in Africa at the end of

    the Civil War, he didn''t even leave his tent to give commands"


    Was this an indication of the experience and initiativeIn particular, his most
    capable commander during

    the Gallic Wars, Labienus, defected to the Pompey early in the Civil War, and

    was one of Caesar''s chief opponents during his African campaign.


    As an interesting note, it seems Labienus likely defected from Caesar for two

    reasons:


    1\. At the beginning of the Civil War it looked extremely unlikely Caesar

    would win.


    2\. Labienus felt as though Caesar took more credit than he ought to have in

    the Gallic Wars, depriving him of his "auctoritas" (sort of prestige) he felt

    he rightfully deserved.


    Caesar''s skilled defeat of Pompey and Labienus show his military skill outside

    of his use of good commanders.

    There is a 500 year difference bt Herodotus and Tacitus. Even so, Herodotus

    did no more than accurately record what he was told, assiduously pointing out

    when he saw something first hand. Early ancient historians made up speeches,

    that much is known. But by Tacitus''s day, the act of writing an objective

    history was not a novelty, and in fact he complains in the beginning of his

    text that he is undertaking the work because he thinks his peers, also

    ostensibly engaged in objective history, have not been objective enough out of

    fear or hatred when covering the reigns of Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and

    Nero. Once again, with no reason to doubt him, I ask: why not even consider

    taking one of the greatest historians whose works have been preserved for

    posterity at faceoffice more unusual. During his time leading Russia, Putin has
    dealt with four separate U.S. presidents as well as four British prime ministers
    and two German chancellors.


    The Kremlin may also dispute the methodology, as Putin wasn''t president for all
    of his time in office. He first became prime minister of Russia on Aug. 16, 1999,
    before entering the presidential office May 7 the next year. Later, as the Russian
    Constitution limits the president to two consecutive terms, Putin stepped out
    of the Kremlin in 2008 while his prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, became president.


    However, most analysts agree that Putin still held the real power during that
    "tandem" presidency. He returned to the presidency in 2012.


    Putin''s increasingly lengthy time in office may not appear to be a problem to
    manyRussians - as widely noted, his approval ratings remain extraordinarily high.
    He is widely expected to stand to be nominated as a presidential candidate again
    for next year''s elections, according to reports in the Russian media.


    But there are some signs of a malaise setting in; some Russians have begun to
    share cynical jokes about Putin that resemble those told during the Brezhnev era.
    Turnout in recent local elections was low, and some polls suggest that a significant
    minority of the country is not sure whether they want Putin to run for reelection.


    Still, Putin is likely to win next year''s election if he runs - potentially putting
    him in office until 2024 (after Medvedev left office, presidential terms were
    increased from four to six years). He could choose toHundreds of soul music enthusiasts
